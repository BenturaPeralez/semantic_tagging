# semantic_tagging
bootcamp homewrok assingment semantic tagging #1 

In this assigment I accomplished the following:
I modified the HTML elements to be semantic elements

I made sure the code followed a logical flow and that the end result was essentially the same image wise as the mock copy

I placed alt attributes on the images

I created a concise and descriptive title 

I wrote comments so people can understand my adjustments to the previous code
